## Graceful Degradation & Service Workers

Service workers enable graceful degradation by allowing a web app to continue functioning even when the network is unavailable. They act as a fallback mechanism, ensuring that cached content is served when a network request fails, helping to improve reliability and performance.

Note: The PWA was tested successfully, and the install button appeared. However, due to system administrator restrictions on my company's device, I could not complete the installation.
